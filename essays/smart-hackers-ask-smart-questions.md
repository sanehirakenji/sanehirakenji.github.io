# Please, I need help ASAP! What is a "Smart Question"?
  In the essay [“How to ask questions the smart way” written by Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), Eric speaks on behalf of the entire community of “hackers” about universal guidelines 
when it comes to asking questions about coding online. The essay creates a clear line between “smart” and “stupid” questions that the reader is able to recognize 
both when reading questions and when developing them. In fact, the header of this section is worded to be a “stupid” question according to Raymond. So how exactly
does Raymond describe this distinction between smart and stupid questions?

  According to Raymond, a “smart” question is one that basically reflects the users’ situational awareness. Raymond describes that people who ask good questions have
already done a decent amount of research on the question that they are asking; the answers they are seeking aren’t right in front of them. The questions are also
asked in the right area and to the right demographic of people. Headers are relevant yet attention-grabbing. On top of all of this, a good question is generally asked
with the implication that the person asking the question will be involved in the answer-retrieval process. These questions are appraised by hackers as they show people
genuinely trying their hardest, and thus are ones that are answered more often.

  On the other hand, a “stupid” question is one that doesn’t meet these “smart” expectations. These are questions that reflect that the person asking didn’t take the time 
of day to do their own research. They can be asked to the completely wrong group of people, with titles that waste time. Going back to the header, the beginning exclamation
of “Please, I need help ASAP!” would place the question in the “stupid” section as it wastes the reader’s time. It is attention-grabbing to a certain extent, but Raymond 
describes that these types of questions are ignored altogether. And finally, a “stupid” question is generally asking other people to answer the question for the user. 
These questions are usually met with backlash from the hacker community, and hackers will make it clear to you when you have asked a stupid question.

That being said, after reading [Raymond’s Article](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), what are some examples of smart and stupid questions?

# A Smart Question

The first [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52473522/node-js-reference-an-inner-property-of-an-object-by-a-variable****) that we will be looking at is an excellent example of a “smart” question. The question asked by user Adam Matan has the header *“Node.js: Reference an inner property of an object by a variable.”* This header immediately grabs the attention of the people reading it, as it describes what the user is looking for and the environment that he needs assistance with. As for the actual question itself, the user is direct and to the point with describing what they are looking for and has explicitly stated that searching online has not yielded their desired results. 

This question was responded to well by the community as another user Atishay Jain answered the question within 5 minutes of Matan asking. Atishay gave a respectful response to the question that was able to answer Adam’s question, which was largely due to the fact that Matan’s question was straight to the point. Atishay even gave some small syntax tips to help Adam with the answer that was given.

# A Really Stupid Question

The following question is an excellent example of a stupid question. The [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56514009/what-is-the-equation-needed-to-find-the-area-of-a-regular-polygon-within-a-circl/56514096) asked by user “M.Davis” has the header *“What is the equation needed to find the area of a regular polygon within a circle when a given no. of sides and radius?”*. The header is exactly the same as the question and is a question that could be answered if the user gave more time into it. The user also posts code without explaining it. The question is also not related to coding in any way, as it is asking for a simple equation.

This question was met with heavy criticism from the StackOverflow community, as even though it was answered fast, the remarks made by the person answering exhibited irritation with the person asking the question. A user DSC responds to the question with an answer to his question, but tells the user to find the formula for themselves as *“Stack Overflow is meant for programming problems”*. Other answers from users include *“This is a geometry problem, not a programming problem.”* and *“Do you know the formula? Paste it in your query so we understand what you are trying to implement.”*, both of which are written very passive-aggressively. One user even votes to close the question, deeming it to be “off-topic”.

# Putting the Pieces Together

Though the majority of this experience was somewhat a review of being courteous when asking questions, I do feel as if having the rules explicitly stated will help me as a programmer. I have never explicitly asked for help online about specific portions of code or errors that I may have run into when writing a program, and thanks to this experience I now understand the rights and wrongs of asking about these topics. Looking at real-life examples in the StackOverflow forum also helped me to see these rules in action and visualize how I would be able to format questions about code in the future.
