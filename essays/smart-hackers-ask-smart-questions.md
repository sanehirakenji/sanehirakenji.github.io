<h1>Please, I need help ASAP! What is a smart question?</h1>
In the essay “How to ask questions the smart way” written by Eric Raymond, Eric speaks on behalf of the entire community of “hackers” about universal guidelines 
when it comes to asking questions about coding online. The essay creates a clear line between “smart” and “stupid” questions that the reader is able to recognize 
both when reading questions and when developing them. In fact, the header of this section is worded to be a “stupid” question according to Raymond. So how exactly
does Raymond describe this distinction between smart and stupid questions?
<br>
  <br>
According to Raymond, a “smart” question is one that basically reflects the users’ situational awareness. Raymond describes that people who ask good questions have
already done a decent amount of research on the question that they are asking; the answers they are seeking aren’t right in front of them. The questions are also
asked in the right area and to the right demographic of people. Headers are relevant yet attention-grabbing. On top of all of this, a good question is generally asked
with the implication that the person asking the question will be involved in the answer-retrieval process. These questions are appraised by hackers as they show people
genuinely trying their hardest, and thus are ones that are answered more often.

  <br>
On the other hand, a “stupid” question is one that doesn’t meet these “smart” expectations. These are questions that reflect that the person asking didn’t take the time 
of day to do their own research. They can be asked to the completely wrong group of people, with titles that waste time. Going back to the header, the beginning exclamation
of “Please, I need help ASAP!” would place the question in the “stupid” section as it wastes the reader’s time. It is attention grabbing to a certain extent, but Raymond 
describes that these types of questions are ignored altogether. And finally, a “stupid” question is generally asking other people to answer the question for the user. 
These question are usually met with backlash from the hacker community, and hackers will make it clear to you when you have asked a stupid question.
<br>
  <br>
That being said, after reading Raymond’s Article, what are some examples of smart and stupid questions?
<h1>A smart question</h1>
<h1>A not so smart question</h1>
<h1>A really stupid question</h1>
