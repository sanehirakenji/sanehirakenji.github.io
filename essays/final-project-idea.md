# Overview
<i>The problem: </i> Many students at UH commute to school via car to "save money" yet with rising gas prices and the hybrid UH classes, driving to school alone can be inefficient and costly to both the student and the economy.

<i>The solution: </i> CarpoolUH is an application for University of Hawaii students, allowing drivers to offer rides and riders to search for rides in their area that work for their schedules.

# Approach 

When a user first creates an account with CarpoolUH, they are met with an account creation field with profile fields including their name, major, a brief bio, and most importantly, their hometown and whether they are a driver or a rider.

# Mockup Page Ideas
