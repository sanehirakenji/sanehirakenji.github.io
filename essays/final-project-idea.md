# Overview
<i>The problem: </i> Many students at UH commute to school via car to "save money" yet with rising gas prices and the hybrid UH classes, driving to school alone can be inefficient and costly to both the student and the economy.

<i>The solution: </i> CarpoolUH is an application for University of Hawaii students, allowing drivers to offer rides and riders to search for rides in their area that work for their schedules.

# Approach 

When a user first creates an account with CarpoolUH, they are met with an account creation field with profile fields including their name, major, a brief bio, a picture of themselves, and most importantly, their hometown and whether they are a driver or a rider. There will also be a field with the best way to contact the driver in question to allow individuals to communicate with eachother about their ride situation.

# Mockup Page Ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
<ul>
  <li>Landing Page</li>
  <li>User Home Page</li>
  <li>Admin Home Page</li>
  <li>User Profile Page</li>
  <li>Riders Page</li>
  <li>Drivers Page</li>
  <li>Fast Ride Page</li>
  <li>Fast Ride Request Form Page</li>
</ul>

# Use Case Ideas
<ul>
  <li>New user goes to the landing page, logs in, gets home page, creates profile as a driver.</li>
  <li>New user goes to the landing page, logs in, gets home page, creates profile as a rider.</li>
  <li>Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, allowed access to edit all pages and monitor driver and rider profiles.</li>
  <li>Rider goes to landing page, logs in, goes to Drivers page and finds right driver, goes to driver profile page to find info.</li>
  <li>Rider goes to landing page, logs in, goes to Fast Ride Request Form Page, fills out form.</li>
  <li>Driver goes to landing page, logs in, finds a suitable rider on the Fast Ride Page, goes to rider profile and contacts rider.</li>
</ul>
# Beyond the Basics
<ul>
  <li>Some sort of incentive system to encourage drivers to look for suitable riders in the Fast Ride Page.</li>
  <li>A rating system for drivers as an added decision making factor above location and time.</li>
  <li>Application-based messaging.</li>
  <li>Real-time "drivers leaving soon" page that shows drivers scheduled to leave in the next 20 minutes.</li>
</ul>
