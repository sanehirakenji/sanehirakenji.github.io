<h1> Unfamiliarity </h1>
The computer science track at the University of Hawaii at Manoa has always been a shaky one as I really had no previous experience with computer science in the past. Growing up I had no problem sitting behind a computer for entire days at a time talking to friends, surfing the internet, and playing video games, but at no point did I ever look into programming or learning a programming language. So immediately after declaring my major as computer science in freshman year, I found it a little difficult to learn and adapt to the terminology of the Java programming language and all of its little intricacies.

Fast forward to the present day, ICS 111 and 211 allowed me to dive into and familiarize myself with Java and the IDE Eclipse, while 311 helped to introduce a multitude of algorithms and datastructures that I would use in programming. I finally felt like I was at some sort of breathing point where I could stop and be comfortable with where I was for a bit, but I also yearned to go above and beyond and learn new things. I wanted to go back to being uncomfortable, the only problem was I didnâ€™t know where to start.
