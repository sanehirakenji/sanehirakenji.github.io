  The basic premise of this project was to create a version of tic tac toe in which the player and opponent are trying <em>not</em> to get 3 Xs and Os in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  More specifically, the prompt required us to create a game of tic tac toe that utilized the skills that we had learned throughout the course of ICS 111. This included creating a JPanel that would display the gameboard of tic tac toe, utilizing switch, if-else, loops, and booleans to ensure the game ran smoothly, and finally creating different methods that would create the foundation of the entire game itself. This was the first project that we had creative liberties over in the class, such that it was one of three different prompts that we could choose from, and we received little to no guidance on how to do it.

  <br>
  Though we had the option to work with others on this final project, due to the online-based nature of COVID-19
