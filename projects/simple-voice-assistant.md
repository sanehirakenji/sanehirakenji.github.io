This was a project that I attempted during Winter 2021. It is based entirely around the discovery that the Marvel Studio's [Iron Man 3 Jarvis app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i5hho2aD-E) was removed from the Apple app store. I wanted to relive my childhood of talking to Jarvis and believed that I would be albe to utilize my computer science knowledge to accomplish this goal.

This was my first experience using Python and using the Python-based IDE <em>PyCharm</em>. Although I had not used python previously, due to knowledge of Java and transferring syntax, I was able to accomplish a simple Python script that accomplished different tasks on my computer by using different if-else statements, switch statements, loops, and methods.

Essentially the app worked as a siri/alexa copycat that replicated the fictional Jarvis AI that was featured in <em>Marvel's Iron Man</em>. The app hosted many features like checking emails, texts, telling the time, temperatures, and telling jokes. At the time of writing this project page, I have gotten the bot to tell the time and tell jokes. I was also able to implement multiple of my own commands including opening files on my computer, playing songs on youtube, and making comments when specific things are mentioned.

Eventually, I would like to hook this script to an arduino and have it control a 3D printed Iron Man suit.
