# Determined Roots

<img class="ui floated left medium image" src="../images/Questions.png" width = "550">
At the beginning of this semester, we were all asked the question “What are you most excited to learn in this course?”. Though others had answers like “I want to build a website” or “I want to learn new programming languages”, my answer to the question was “I want to learn how to apply the knowledge gained from previous courses into a working application”. This is because, in all of the previous Computer Science courses, we have learned how to develop code and run code in consoles or small windows, but we had never actually developed an application that was easily accessible to others. From the start, I knew exactly what I was going for, and the course itself delivered by teaching us to use the code we write to impact or even create web applications.
